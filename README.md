# README

This is a ClassPass-esque site written in Ruby on Rails. I've created the site as a learning project to improve my understanding of Rails. I'm loosely following Michael Hartls Ruby on Rails tutorial. 

Still very much a work in progress, but the final project should:

* have a user signup

* allow users to create a profile for clubs/groups/teams

* allow the public to filter and search clubs/groups/teams by location or type

* allow users to post messages to the profiles

* allow users to follow profiles for updates
